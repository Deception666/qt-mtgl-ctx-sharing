Enclosed in this package are fully textured, 3D models ready-to-use with the Delta3D Open Source Game and Simulation Engine. 
Many of the models were created at the MOVES Institute at the Naval Post Graduate School in Monterey, CA. 
Others have been donated for distribution and use by Delta3D partners and friends of the community. THANK YOU! 

These models are being offered as part of a free package distributed by the Delta3D team in conjunction with their Open Source Game and Simulation Engine.

Every model is ready to load into Delta3D in either .flt, .osg, or .ive.
All models have an editable version as well, which are .MAX and .FLT.

While these models are free for use and re-distribution, we request that credit be given to the artists in one form or another wherever these models may end up.

Thank you,

The Delta3D Development Team
